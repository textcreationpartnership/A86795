            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Beleeve you expect not a preſent and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Anſwer to your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, becauſe it is new unto Me: Onely in generall I muſt tell you, That I ſee by it, that I am not deceived in the Confidence I have in the Affections of this County to my Perſon and State; and I aſſure you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:156594:5"/>
that I will not deceive your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which at this time you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in your Petition, to have in Me: And I am glad to ſee that it is not upon miſtaken Grounds, as other Petitions have been to me ſince I came to this place: Concerning which, let me obſerve unto you, That my Anſwers were to cleer thoſe miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for I never did goe about to puniſh or diſcourage them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning to Me in an humble way, though the ſubject did not agree with my Senſe; Albeit within the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of man, people have been diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and threatned to be puniſhed for Petitions.</p>
            <p>I obſerve that your Petition is ſo modeſt, that it doth not mention any particular for your own good; which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156594:5"/>
indeed I expected, as knowing that in ſome particulars you have great reaſon to do; and therefore, that you may not fare the worſe for your Modeſty, I will put you in minde of three particulars, which I conceive to be for the good of this Country.</p>
            <p>The firſt is concerning your train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bands, to reduce them to a leſſer number, for which, I confeſſe to ſtand engaged by promiſe to you, which I had performed long ſince, if I had been put in minde of it: And now I tell you, Shew me but the Way, and (when you ſhall think fit) I ſhall inſtantly reduce them to that Number, which I promiſed you two yeers agoe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That which is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this County for Billet-money;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156594:6"/>
The truth is, That for the preſent I cannot repay it; Onely I will ſay this, That if all the Water had gone to the right Mill (upon my Word) you had been long agoe ſatisfied in this particular. And ſo I leave to your diſcretions which way you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and aſſiſt Me to comply with the Engagements to you in this point.</p>
            <p>The third is, That for which I was petitioned as I came up the laſt yeer, both by the Lord Major and Aldermen of this City, and likewiſe by divers others of this County, as I went South-ward; And that is, concerning the Court of <hi>York.</hi> And firſt let Me tell you, That as yet I know no Legall Diſſolution of it, for hitherto formally there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156594:6"/>
come to Me, either directly or indirectly, for the taking of it away: therefore I may ſay, It is rather ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces, then diſſolved. Now my Deſire is, in complyance to what I anſwered the laſt year unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Petitions delivered to Me upon this ſubject, That you would conſult and agree among your ſelves in what manner you would have the Court eſtabliſhed, moſt to your own contentments, and to the good of all theſe Northern parts, in ſuch a Legall way, as that it may not juſtly be excepted againſt; and I aſſure you, in the word of an honeſt Man, that you ſhall not blame Me, if you have not full ſatisfaction in it.</p>
            <p>Within a day or two ye ſhall have a particular Anſwer to your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156594:7"/>

the Propagation of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion amongſt vs, againſt all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of Popery, is onely to ſhew your Confidence in his princely VVord; wherein He again hath commanded me to aſſure you, That He will neither deceive your truſt, nor wrong Himſelf ſo much as not to be uery punctuall in performance of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments He hath already made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe particulars, which beſides the performance of His VVord (which He holds moſt deer unto him) his own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions naturally induce Him unto.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Prayer of your Petition, His Majeſtie doth graciouſly interpret, That your deſiring Him to declare ſuch

fit means and expedients as may take away all Diſtance and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings betwixt His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and His great Councell, is no otherwiſe then to have the more authentique ground, and the better direction which way to carry your ſelves in your Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Parliament for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
